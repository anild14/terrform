Kubernetes Components
Refer Here for the k8s components article
Control plane components (Master Node Components)
kube-api server
etcd (*)
kube-scheduler
controller manager
cloud controller manager
Node Components
kubelet
kube-proxy
Container run time (*)
kube-api server
Handles all the communication of k8s cluster
Let it be internal or external
kube-api server exposes functionality over HTTP(s) protocol and provides REST API
etcd
Refer Here for etcd
This is memory of k8s cluster

scheduler
Scheduler is responsible for creating k8s objects and scheduling them on right node
Controller
Controller Manger is responsible for maintaining desired state
This reconcilation loop that checks for desired state and if it mis matches doing the necessary steps is done by controller
Kubelet
This is an agent of the control plane
Container Runtime
Container technology to be used in k8s cluster
in our case it is docker.
Kube-Proxy
This component is responsible for networking for containers on the node
kubectl
This is command line that can be installed on the machine from which you communicate to k8s cluster.
This tool is created to make communication with api-server simplified.
Kubectl has a config file (KUBECONFIG) which contains
api-server information
keys to communicate with api server
Kubectl allows to communication with cluster to create resources
imperatively: Type commands
declartively: Write manifests (YAML files)
Reads manifests and connects to api server. Converts the manifest into REST API calls over JSON
What is k8s manifest
This is a yaml file which describes the desired state of what you want in/using k8s cluster

Kubernetes as a Service
All popular clouds are offering k8s as a service
AKS (Azure K8s service)
EKS (Elastic K8s Service)
GKE (Google K8s engine)
All cloud providers manage control plane for you and they charge hourly. For nodes we pay the similar costs of virtual machines

Playground (for learning): Refer Here
Installing k8s cluster on ubuntu vms
Create 3 ubuntu vms which are accesible to each other with atlest 2 vCPUS and 4 GB RAM
Installation method (kubeadm) which is something we will be using in on-premises k8s.
Refer Here for kubeadm installation on single master node
Steps
Install docker on all nodes
Install CRI-Dockerd Refer Here
Run the below commands as root user in all the nodes
# Run these commands as root
###Install GO###
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/getgo/installer_linux
chmod +x ./installer_linux
./installer_linux
source ~/.bash_profile

git clone https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd.git
cd cri-dockerd
mkdir bin
go build -o bin/cri-dockerd
mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
install -o root -g root -m 0755 bin/cri-dockerd /usr/local/bin/cri-dockerd
cp -a packaging/systemd/* /etc/systemd/system
sed -i -e 's,/usr/bin/cri-dockerd,/usr/local/bin/cri-dockerd,' /etc/systemd/system/cri-docker.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable cri-docker.service
systemctl enable --now cri-docker.socket
Installing kubadm, kubectl, kubelet Refer Here
Now create a cluster from a master node Refer Here
use the command kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr "10.244.0.0/16" --cri-socket "unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock"
Setup kubeconfig
install flannel kubectl apply -f https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/latest/download/kube-flannel.yml
AS a root user run kubeadm join commands (need to pass crisocket)
Now from manager execute kubectl get nodes
